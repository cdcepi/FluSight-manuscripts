Model variables and parameters are sequentially updated each week using the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter and new observations. Forecasts are generated by integrating the optimized model into the future. Four statitical models are included in the ensemble: A Historical-drift model - a random drift model where the mean and variance of the drift for each week and location are derived by sampling first-order lags in incidence from historical data where sampling is performed using a window around the current week of the year (e.g., during epiweek 47, the model samples from a window around epiweek 47 in previous years).

As of 2024-11-23, these are equally weighted. Categorical predictions are derived from the quantile predictions by fitting a monotonic spline to interpolate the quantiles.
2024-11-30: Our model is not responding well to data anomalies in OH. We have dropped that state from this week's submission. 2024-12-07: We dropped forecasts for PR. We have low confidence in forecasts from AZ, but are submitting them regardless. 2025-01-02: For this week, we include only the GBQR model. The AR(6) model does not have any features that allow it to capture regular seasonal effects, and exploration of last season's forecasts showed that it underperformed in the weeks immediately following Christmas.
